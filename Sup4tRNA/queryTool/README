This is the package for querying Sprinzl's aligned database.
1. query.py is the script that does the job.
2. filter.in is the input file that need user to define the querying terms.
it looks like this:
#define locations and bases for the filter. The location number is real index not system numbering
#locations	base (accept both U and T)
18	G
20	!T
22     U

User need to edit the columns of positons, which is using the real index not systematic numbering. The indexing can certainly be changed to systematic way, but I figured it might be somehow evern more confusing by defining variable loop. The base can be defined with "!" meaning NOT, both U and G will be accepted.

The usage:
Mac or linux users can open the query folder and type in terminals:
query1.0.py filter.in prefix_output

3. output files:
each single piece of query will have a individual output file, which takes the prefix_output from commandline as the prefix for output files. Then a output prefix_all.out will hold all the crossing filtered outputs.

4. tRNAs.mfa
the Sprinzl's 9758 fasta sequences database.

5. tRNA_index
the indexing reference for the numbering, which will helps to locate the positions you want to search.
